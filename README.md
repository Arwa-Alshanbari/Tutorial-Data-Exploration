# Data Exploration: Credit Scoring Tutorial

This Jupyter Notebook, `Tutorial_Pyhton.ipynb`, is designed to guide you through the process of data exploration with a focus on credit scoring. It is aimed at beginners and intermediate users who are interested in learning how to handle, analyze, and derive insights from credit scoring data using Python. Below is an overview of what each section in the notebook covers:

## Sections

### Import the Libraries
- Introduction to the Python libraries used in this tutorial (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) and their purposes.

### Read the Data
- Instructions on how to load the credit scoring dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### DATA DESCRIPTION
- An overview of the dataset, including the types of variables it contains and their relevance to credit scoring.
- A preliminary assessment of the dataset's organization, identifying potential issues that need cleaning or restructuring.
- A quick exploration to understand the size and shape of the dataset.
- A detailed description of each column in the dataset, explaining what kind of information it holds regarding credit scoring.

### Missing Data Point
- Techniques to identify and handle missing data points in the dataset, ensuring the analysis is accurate and reliable.

### Visualizing Data
- Demonstrations of how to use visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.

### Understanding Data â€“ Data Exploration
- In-depth analysis and exploration of specific columns in the dataset, such as `days_employed`, `dob_years`, `education`, `family_status`, `gender`, `income_type`, `debt`, `total_income`, and `purpose`. This section dives into each attribute's significance, distribution, and its impact on credit scoring.
